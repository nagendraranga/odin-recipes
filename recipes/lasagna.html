	 Get your grilling skills up to snuff before grill 
       season. For the grilling novice, chicken is a great 
       place to start because it's not as finicky as

       wings, we'll walk you step-by-step through grilling 
       chicken so you can be a backyard hero this grills

    <h2>Instructions:</h2> 
      <ol>
           <li><strong>Pound chicken.</strong> The key to a great grilled chicken breast is in the prep. Place the chicken breasts between two 
      pieces of wax paper. Use the flat side of a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound the meat. Don't completely destroy it, 
      but do flatten it slightly so that it cooks more evenly.  </li>
          <li> <strong>Marinate.</strong> For this tutorial, we're going to be using a simple marinade based on Denise Boyd's Marinated Grill 
      Chicken II recipe, but you can use any chicken marinade you'd like. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel, and place in 
      a shallow bowl. Pour the salad dressing over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least three hours. Once you're 
      done marinating, remove chicken from the fridge and season with lemon pepper and salt to taste. Allow the chicken to sit 
      out for 15 to 30 minutes so that it starts to come to room temperature.  </li> 
      <li>
        <strong> Prep grill.</strong> Go ahead and start grill prep while your chicken is finishing up marinating. Dampen a paper towel with 
      cooking oil and use a pair of tongs to run it over a clean grill rack, coating the rack with oil. Heat the grill on 
      medium-high heat.  </li> 
      <li> 
       <strong> Grill.</strong> Place the chicken on the grill and cover. Cook for seven to eight minutes per side (15 minutes per side if 
        bone-in), or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. </li>
      <li> <strong> Let it rest.</strong> Don't carve your chicken just yet! Remove it from the grill and cover it with foil. Let it rest for five to 10 minutes, so that the juices have time to distribute throughout the meat. Otherwise, they'll end up all over your cutting board or plate. </li>
      <li> <strong> Serve </strong>Now you're ready to serve your chicken! Cut it up for use in salads, pasta dishes, or tacos. Or serve it whole with one of these favorite sides for grilled chicken. </li>
